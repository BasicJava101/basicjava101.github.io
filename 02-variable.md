title: Variable
---

A variable is a name you give to a value. Variable is useful especially when you have to use the value multiple times. For example, let's say you want to find a cub of a number. You multiple the number 3 times.

```
4 * 4 * 4
```

Now you decide to change your mind and you want to find the cube of 10, then you have to change everywhere you see 4 to a 10 so it will look like this:

```
10 * 10 * 10
```

This is could lead to mistakes. What if you forgot to change a number? It also doesn't say much about the number. However, if you named that number, it will ensure that everywhere you used the number, the value will change. You can also give it a more descriptive name so you can understand what the code is doing.

```
int numberToCube = 4;

numberToCube * numberToCube * numberToCube;
```
